        <h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a fourth-year journalism student at UF. I am 22 years old. I am originally from Tampa, and I have a toy yorkie named Rico. I grew up with my mom, dad, and younger brother who is turning 18 this month and waiting to see if he got into UF!
        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p>My favorite thing to do is go to the beach. Honeymoon Island in Dunedin is the best beach ever, in my opinion. I love swimming in the ocean and reading at the beach, too. I also really like music. Some of my favorite artists are Tyler, The Creator, Childish Gambino, No Doubt, and Alex G. My favorite song at the moment is Rock the Casbah by The Clash. A new years resolution of mine is to read more, and my favorite books are The Humans by Matt Haig and The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath. I also like to work out and roller skate. Because I am a journalism major, I also love writing and video editing. I currently intern for Irving Publications where I write for two local magazines, and I am also interning for the UF Alumni Association and writing for Florida GATOR Magazine.</p>
        <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <p>Other than my hobbies, I am also interested in web design and development, hence why I am in this course! I am also interested in movies. I probably watch at least four movies per week. I love Star Wars, and Revenge of the Sith and The Empire Strikes Back are my favorite ones. My favorite movies of all time are Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, When Harry Met Sally, and Isle of Dogs.
        <h2>My Career Goals</h2>
        <p>My career goal is to ultimately have a job that doesn't feel like work. I want to do something I am passionate about, whether that is something in the web design field or journalism field doing storytelling, reporting, or video editing. I used to want to make documentaries, but my career interests have expanded since then. Honestly, I am still unsure of any specific career goals, but at least I have narrowed down the fields I want a career in.</p>
